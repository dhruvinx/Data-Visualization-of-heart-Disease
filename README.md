# Data-Visualization-of-heart-Disease-Prediction
Explore the correlation between heart disease and health indicators in this Data Visualization course project. Utilizing Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair, and Plotly, this repository showcases interactive and static visualizations of a comprehensive heart dataset.

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of a heart disease dataset aimed at uncovering relationships between various health indicators and the prevalence of heart disease. The analysis is performed using Python, with visualizations created through libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair, and Plotly.

### Objectives
- To analyze heart disease data to identify key indicators of heart disease.
- To visualize data interactions using various plotting libraries to provide insights into heart health trends.
- To employ interactive visualizations for dynamic data exploration.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 1,025 entries with 14 attributes related to heart health including age, sex, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and more. This data was sourced from a public health database and accessed via Google Colab.

### Data Attributes
- `age`: Age of the patient
- `sex`: Sex of the patient (`1`: Male, `0`: Female)
- `cp`: Chest pain type (4 values)
- `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure
- `chol`: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (`1`: True, `0`: False)
- `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
- `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved
- `exang`: Exercise induced angina (`1`: yes, `0`: no)
- `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- `slope`: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
- `thal`: Thalassemia (3 types)
- `target`: Diagnosis of heart disease (`1`: disease, `0`: no disease)

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for static visualizations
- Altair for interactive visualizations
- Plotly for advanced interactive visualizations
- Google Colab for project execution and environment management

## Visualizations
- **Heatmap**: To observe correlations between all numerical variables.
- **Pairplot**: Visual interactions between pairs of variables differentiated by sex.
- **Histograms and Bar Charts**: To analyze frequency distributions and count comparisons across categorical variables.
- **Scatter Plots with Regression Lines**: To observe relationships and trends between two quantitative variables.
- **Interactive Plots**: To dynamically explore data points across multiple dimensions.
